<div class="blurb">
<p>I have a complicated relationship with myself in regards to running. It has long been a part of how I define myself, but also feels out of reach or a dusty relic. A recent medical diagnosis (or rather, confirming a long-standing *misdiagnosis*) has provided a foray into training with focus once again after a number of off years. I would like to document my experience and processes here.</p>

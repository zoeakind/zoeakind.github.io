<div class="blurb">
	<h1>I don't know, either.</h1>
	<p>I’ve ingested all the important lessons and pieces from each position and institution i’ve worked with, and every little thing that snowballs into a bigger problem always seems to hinge upon communication. Some combination of what isn't getting through (both internally or externally), where is there common language, whom is presuming what based on nothing but intuition when data is available, where do individuals feel empowered to convey what expertise they maintain.
<p>By nature, I take a macro-level view to the lay of the land, and spot where the frailties lay so as to try and ease problems before they transpire. Proactive communication. I think that’s why I feel so at ease working on larger-scale websites with many wiggling arms. Does the left hand know what the right holds onto? Probably not.</p>
In having an understanding of what’s transpiring, I create more cohesive pieces of communication that flow, that allow end users to get what information they need, make sure it conveys the right message/tone, and go about their day. A good digital experience can be defined as one where you don't have to think about where to go, what to do to find what you need without knowing the specific frameworks and nomenclature of an organization. As a digital overseer, you have to be able to remove your bias and skills to consider your users to have minimal-to-no presumed experience in the same way you do. I think that is incredibly important, and I take that with me in all projects and experiences created.</p>

	<h1>Thinking, overthinking.</h1>
	<p>Working on improving my Markdown abilities, writing about something eventually.</p>
	<p>Middle child possessing many middle names.<br>
		Horrendous handwriting.<br> I don’t cook as much as I would like.<br>
		No cream or sugar, and I think I prefer the flavor profile of South American options over African coffee beans.<br>
		I don’t have a clue about wine.</p>
